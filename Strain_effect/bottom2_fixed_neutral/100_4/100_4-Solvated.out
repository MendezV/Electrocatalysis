Initialization of PSM library failed.

  Error: PSM is in the finalized state
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
allocate some locked memory.  This typically can indicate that the
memlock limits are set too low.  For most HPC installations, the
memlock limits should be set to "unlimited".  The failure occured
here:

  Local host:    node2016
  OMPI source:   btl_openib.c:753
  Function:      ompi_free_list_init_ex_new()
  Device:        qib0
  Memlock limit: 65536

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.  This FAQ entry on the Open MPI web site may also be
helpful:

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD 
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
