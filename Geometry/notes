For the 100 surface of bct (110 of the fct )
First scaled the unit cell by two diag(2 2 2) (in edit-> unit cell -> remove symmetries-> transform)
then rotated the a to the c axis with ((0,0,2),(0,2,0),(-2,0,0))  (this comes from the rotation matrix from 100 to 001 in rotation.py and the factor of two is a mystery(should have already been taken into account in the first scaling))
then inserted the planes

For the 110 surface of bct (100 of the fct)
First started defining the unit cell as triclinic with strain applied in the a axis
rotated the b and c axis with (100 011 0-11)
initialized current matrix and then applied the scaling in the c direction


For the 101 surface of bct (111 of the fct)
First started defining the unit cell as triclinic with strain applied in the c axis
rotated the a and c axis with (101 010 -101)
initialized current matrix and then applied the scaling in the c direction


red is zero strain
