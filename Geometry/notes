For the 100 surface of bct (110 of the fct )
First scaled the unit cell by two diag(2 2 2) (in edit-> unit cell -> remove symmetries-> transform)
then rotated the a to the c axis with ((0,0,2),(0,2,0),(-2,0,0))  (this comes from the rotation matrix from 100 to 001 in rotation.py and the factor of two is a mystery(should have already been taken into account in the first scaling))
then inserted the planes

For the 110 surface of bct (100 of the fct)
First started defining the unit cell as triclinic with strain applied in the a axis
rotated the b and c axis with (100 011 0-11)
initialized current matrix and then applied the scaling in the c direction


For the 101 surface of bct (111 of the fct)
First started defining the unit cell as triclinic with strain applied in the c axis
rotated the a and c axis with (101 010 -101)
initialized current matrix and then applied the scaling in the c direction


red is zero strain
green is 2.7740	2.7740	3.9230
purple is 2.7202	2.7202	3.7172
blue is 2.7445	2.7445	3.6510
yellow is 2.7478	2.7478	3.6130


TO cleave surface
first scale 1.5 to influde the fifth layer (search atoms to maintain lattice)
(for 110 and 111 rotate xy vectors to with (1-10 110 001) to make slightly bigger surface so that molecules fit)
then scale 2 and select do nothing to create vacuum
then remove redundant atoms in structure params
then remove by hand atoms that dont belong to the surface
then shift by 0.166667 to recenter Slab
then remove planes

every surface should have different vaccuums, the same fractional coordinates
different lattices and the same number of atoms (20)
